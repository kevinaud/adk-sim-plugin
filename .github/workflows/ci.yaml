# ============================================================
# Continuous Integration Pipeline
# ============================================================
# Runs quality checks and tests on all PRs and pushes to main.
#
# Architecture:
#   - Main 'check' job uses lightweight setup (no devcontainer)
#   - Devcontainer verification only runs when .devcontainer/ changes
#
# Local testing:
#   ops ci test ci          # Run this workflow locally with act
#   ops ci check            # Run same checks without act
